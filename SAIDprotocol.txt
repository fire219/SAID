SAID -- Serial Arduino Input Device
Explanation of Serial protocol
---------------------------------------------

SAID sends the input data over a virtual serial port to the host PC. Since a serial connection is not always reliable, this protocol was developed to use as little data as possible per event.

Data is encoded into two character strings of numbers, followed by the "\r\n" EOL sequence. 

Each individual input is assigned a number. For a 4-switch joystick plus trigger, these numbers are:

up ------ 1
down ---- 7
left ---- 11
right --- 15
trigger - 19

For multiple inputs at once, the numbers of the individual events are added, as such:

up + trigger ----- 20
down + trigger --- 26
left + trigger --- 30
right + trigger -- 34
upper left ------- 12
upper right ------ 16
lower left ------- 18
lower right ------ 22
UL + trigger ----- 31
UR + trigger ----- 35
DL + trigger ----- 37
DR + trigger ----- 41

As you can see, the individual numbers were chosen so that no two events can have the same number.

These numbers are padded with a leading zero if needed to make it two-digits. The data is then sent over serial to the computer.
