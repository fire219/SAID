SAID
Serial Arduino Input Device

SAID is a basic way to turn an Arduino wired with switches and buttons into a gamepad or digital joystick.

NOTE: SAID is Windows only right now, due to use of hooks into the Windows API.

How to use SAID out of the box
______________________________

In it's preconfigured setup of a 4-switch digital joystick with a trigger, connect each switch to ground and the other end to:

Down - pin 7
Up - pin 6
Left - pin 4
Right - pin 5
Trigger - pin 3

Load the Arduino with the sketch.

Change the COM port in the Python script.

Start the Python script.

If all went right, your SAID powered joystick should be working and ready for action.

Explanation of Serial Protocol
______________________________

SAID sends the input data over a virtual serial port to the host PC. 

Since a serial connection is not always reliable, this protocol was 

developed to use as little data as possible per event.

Data is encoded into two character strings of numbers, followed by the 

"\r\n" EOL sequence. 

Each individual input is assigned a number. For a 4-switch joystick plus 

trigger, these numbers are:

up ------ 1
down ---- 7
left ---- 11
right --- 15
trigger - 19

For multiple inputs at once, the numbers of the individual events are 

added, as such:

up + trigger ----- 20
down + trigger --- 26
left + trigger --- 30
right + trigger -- 34
upper left ------- 12
upper right ------ 16
lower left ------- 18
lower right ------ 22
UL + trigger ----- 31
UR + trigger ----- 35
DL + trigger ----- 37
DR + trigger ----- 41

As you can see, the individual numbers were chosen so that no two events 

can have the same number.

These numbers are padded with a leading zero if needed to make it two-

digits. The data is then sent over serial to the computer.
